<b>Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository!</b><br><br>
I created this repository to showcase my learning journey in <b>Machine Learning</b>. After completing a comprehensive course and several hands-on tutorials, I decided to organize and share my projects, notes, and experiments in one place.<br><br>

<b>Key Highlights:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Implementation of basic and advanced ML algorithms</li>
  <li>Use of Python libraries like <code>scikit-learn</code>, <code>pandas</code>, <code>matplotlib</code>, and <code>numpy</code></li>
  <li>Practical examples on classification, regression, clustering, and more</li>
</ul>

Feel free to explore the notebooks and scripts, and connect with me if you're also passionate about data science and ML!
